##This repo containts a collection of projects I've completed.



###Repo for the Practical Machine Learning Course Project in the Coursera and John Hopkins Data Science Specialization
index.html is the html product of the project. It can be accessed at: https://jp92015.github.io/

Course Project.Rmd is the R markdown version of the project. It is available at:  https://github.com/JP92015/JP92015.github.io/blob/master/Course%20Project.Rmd


###Process Exam Results
This is an R script I created to take student exam results from Blackboard, extract 
relevant content and sumamrize findings for manual entry into another platform.

###Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
This code was written to complete the Coursera Data Science Specialization Course Project for the Exploratory Data Analysis Project.
This project entailed taking raw data about electrical consumption and visualizing the data through plots. The challenge was to create plots exactly as shown in examples. Plots can be viewed at this repo: https://github.com/JP92015/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-1


###Run Analysis
This was a project to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Coursera Data Science Specialization. 
run_analysis contains a script to load test and training data from the UCI HAR Dataset, compute means by activity and subject from reported variable means, and returns this data in tidy format. More information can be found in the original repo: https://github.com/JP92015/Course-Project
