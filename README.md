## Compilation of some data sciencey scripts I've written in R
This is forked from my old github account, which I no longer update. I plan to update this repo with more projects when I have the time to tinker in data science.


### Data Interpretation
[This project](https://jp92015.github.io/) was completed for the **Practical Machine Learning** course in the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). There is also an [R markdown](https://github.com/JP92015/JP92015.github.io/blob/master/Course%20Project.Rmd) version.

The goal of the project was to train a machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the way in which a barbell lift was performed, using data from accelerometers on participantsâ€™ belt, forearm, arm and dumbell. I used a random forest algorithm to predict actions with high accuracy.


### Data Processing
[R script](https://github.com/JP92015/Sample-Work/blob/master/Process%20Exam%20Results) I created to take exam results from a Blackboard course, extract
relevant content and summarize findings for faculty review.


### Visualizing Electrical Consumption
[Course project](https://github.com/JP92015/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-1) for the **Exploratory Data Analysis** [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
This project entailed taking raw data about electrical consumption and visualizing the data through creating specific plots.


### Run Analysis
[This code](https://github.com/JP92015/Course-Project/blob/master/Run%20Analysis) and [repo](https://github.com/JP92015/Course-Project) were a project completing the **Getting and Cleaning Data** course in the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
The run_analysis script loads and tests training data from the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), computes averages by activity and subject from it, and returns this data in [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format.
